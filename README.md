# Will Covid-19 be with us forever?

I truly believe we are all tired of hearing the word 'Pandemic', 'Covid-19', 'Social Distance' and 'Wearing Mask'. Some of us don't even want to talk about the situation happened back in Year 2020, 2021 and 2022, and may have blocked these out of our minds. 

But I am curious as to how is Covid-19 in April 2023 especially with the new variant (Arcturus, XBB 1.16) that is causing a surge in Covid-19 infection. Apart from the usual high fever and cough, pink eyes or sticky red eyes were dubbed as one of the symptom. 

Based on dataset extracted from Our World In Data: Covid-19 dataset as of 19th April 2023, mortality rate stood at 0.9% out of 763 millions of reported Covid-19 cases. Europe held the highest death count at 2 millions, and followed by Asia at 1.6 millions deaths.

Zooming into ASEAN countries, a slight surge was witnessed during 1st half of 2022. That is when most of the countries have had enough of the restrictions, and realised the human race can't continue living like this and decided to face Covid-19 head on. As of 19th April 2023, almost 40% of Singapore populations were infected with Covid-19. Malaysia reported almost 15%, Vietnam 12%, Thailand 7% and Indonesia 3% but I believe these numbers are under-reported especially among the developing countries. I have personally seen people around me got Covid-19 positive, but still goes on with their life as usual or self-medicate at home with store-bought drugs. At least to me, Covid-19 has become just a common ilness.
